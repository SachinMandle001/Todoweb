ToDo Web App (MERN Stack)

This is a full-stack ToDo web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js). The app allows users to perform complete CRUD operations on their tasks:

Create new tasks
Read and view the task list
Update task status
monitor task progress
Delete completed or unnecessary tasks

The interface is simple, clean, and user-friendly, enabling efficient task management. All task data is stored in a MongoDB database, with real-time updates managed via a RESTful API built with Express and Node.js. React handles the dynamic frontend, offering a responsive experience.
